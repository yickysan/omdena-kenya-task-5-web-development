# Predicting Road Accident Severity

## Project Goals
* This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict road accidents in Kenya.
* Analyze and understand the patterns and contributing factors of accidents on Kenyan roads using * historical accident data.
* Identify accident-prone areas (hotspots) by analyzing accidents' spatial and temporal patterns.
* Develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of accidents based on various factors such as road conditions, weather, time of day, and vehicle types.
